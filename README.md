Loan Classification (whether 'Paid Off' or 'In Collection') is performed using Multiple Classification Algorithms to find the best algorithm for the specific dataset ustilizing various accuracy evaluation methods while tuning the 'Hyperparameters' and visualizing the orginal data for preprocessing as well as the results

Classification Algorithms Explored: K Nearest Neighbor(KNN), Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression

Accuracy evaluation methods used: Jaccard Similarity Score, F-score and Log Loss

Visualization libraries used: 'Matplotlib' and 'Searborn'
